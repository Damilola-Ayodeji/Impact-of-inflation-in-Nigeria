# Definitions
### Consumer Price Index 
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices consumers pay for a representative basket of consumer goods and services. The CPI is a measure of and reflects inflation as experienced by consumers in their day-to-day living expenses. It is also known as the headline CPI. 

            CPI = ( Value of Basket in Current Year / Value of Basket in Base year ) x 100

### Inflation
Inflation is a gradual loss of purchasing power that is reflected in a broad rise in prices for goods and services over time. It allows for a single-value representation of the increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy over a specified time.

            Inflation rate = ( Current CPI – Old CPI / Old CPI ) x 100

The dataset was provided by Cortouch Media.

It contains 17 columns and about 350 rows.

It contained the Consumer Price Index and Inflation rate for 3 categories of goods and services (All items, Food, and Core-CPI - All items less Farm produce and Energy) from January 1995 to January 2024.


# The Objective

# Key Questions

- How has the CPI changed over time?
- How does the monthly inflation trend compare to the yearly inflation trend?
- How does the current inflation rate compare to previous rates?


# Tools used & Skills demonstrated in this project

- Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning
- Power BI: Data transformation and Visualization
